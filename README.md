# Football_Analysis
Football Analysis using YOLO
This project utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to perform football analysis, detecting players, referees, and the ball in football images and videos. The YOLO model is trained and customized to achieve accurate detection results for football-related objects.

# Project Setup

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have the ultralytics and roboflow Python packages installed. The following commands can be used to install the required packages:

bash

pip install ultralytics==8.0.20

pip install roboflow

# Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Roboflow. The dataset includes annotated images and labels for players, referees, and the ball. The dataset is accessed using the Roboflow API and downloaded for training and validation.

# Custom Training

The project uses a custom training process to train the YOLO model on the provided dataset. The following steps are involved in the custom training:

The dataset is downloaded from Roboflow using the API.

Training is performed using the YOLOv8 model architecture.

The training process runs for a specified number of epochs (e.g., 50) with an image size of 800x800 pixels.

Plots are generated to visualize the training progress, including the confusion matrix and results.

# Validation

After the custom model is trained, validation is performed to assess its performance. The model is evaluated using the validation dataset to measure its accuracy and detection capabilities.

# Inference

Inference is the process of using the trained YOLO model to make predictions on new, unseen data. In this project, inference is carried out on both images and videos to detect players, referees, and the ball in football-related content.

# Image Inference

The model predicts object detections on individual images, and the results are saved for further analysis. Example images from the inference process are displayed for visual inspection.

# Video Inference

The trained model is also applied to analyze videos. The model processes each frame of the video to detect objects and track their movements throughout the video. The resulting video with annotated detections is saved for review.

# Results

This project aims to provide accurate object detection for players, referees, and the ball in football-related content. The trained YOLO model is capable of detecting these objects in both images and videos, showcasing its potential for football analysis applications.
